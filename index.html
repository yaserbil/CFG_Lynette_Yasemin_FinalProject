			    <h2>Spectre</h2>
			    <p><i>Spectre Review: License to thrill?</i></p>

			    <p>Following suit to the the most successful British film ever with Skyfall, Spectre was not an easy challenge for its director Sam Mendes. The film opening is set in Mexico City during the Day of the Dead parade. However once this action-packed part is over, Sam Smith's song "Writings on the Wall" lulls the audience and sets the slower pace for the rest of the 148 minutes of runtime.</p>

				<p>Adding to the lenth of the film, the villain played by Christph Waltz comes across more ludicrous than scary and a reveal about his identity does not convince. After the successful story of Bond's true origins in Skyfall, Spectre attempts to give Bond yet another origins story - and utterly fails.</p>

				<p>Bond attends a meeting to uncover the existance of a secret organisation called SPECTRE and slowly infiltrates it. Despite the chance to point to terrorism nowadays, it merely points out campaigns against government monitoring of internet data. All in all, the film does not provide an underlying idea and does not add a new flavour to the Bond movies we know.</p>

			    <h2>Jurassic World</h2>
			    <p><i>Jurassic World Review>: Roller coaster ride of the summer?<i></p>

				<p>This summer's thrill ride was just that, a high octane, adrenaline pumping, action feast, just like a rider on a roller coaster, and when the ride was over it's on to the next.</p>

				<p>Despite the majestic John Williams score and the many left homages to the original Spielberg masterclass this film fell flat, much like Chris Pratt's well sculpted abdomen. In between the rancour and intensity of raptor chases was only the hollow scenes of fraternal bonding and failed romance between the protagonists.</p>
				
				<p>Jurassic World needed more clear substance to complement the breathtaking action and focus on the story lines of only a few core characters. It's fun, big, and the action makes you dizzy - just like a roller coaster ride.</p>

			    <h2>Mad Max</h2>
			    <p>Thanks to Nomura colleagues who are members of our Friends of Rays of Sunshine scheme and make a monthly donation of £10, the charity is able to grant more wishes of seriously ill children and young adults, like Toby. </p>

				<p>Toby, who is 18 years old, was diagnosed with cancer of the kidney at a very young age. He eventually lost his kidney and had a heart transplant in September 2013. Toby has wanted to be an actor for as long as he can remember and as he has always been a fan of the TV series Blackadder, his wish was to meet actor Stephen Fry. With funds donated by Nomura Friends his wish came true.</p>
